# dgMicMute
This is a tool which allows you to mute your microphone in a convenient way.

## History
One day, a co-worker asked if someone knows a small tool, which allows him to mute his microphone, like he can mute the audio.
We were a little bit confused, because no one knows such a tool. However, most (if not all) Ultrabooks or Notebooks have a microphone equipped.
So I decided to write this little tool.

It resides in the notification area as a mircofone symbol (keep in mind to make it visible, it's normally hidden). With a simple right-click, you can (un-)mute your microphone.
It even has a *force-mode*, where it tries to prevent other applications from re-enabling the microphone (E.g. Skype does this. NSA might do it. :P).

## Features
- Mutes your microphone with a single left-click (on the icon)
- Adds a "force"-flag so that third party applications cannot "unmute" the microphone
- Hotkey! (Thanks [@sco3tt](https://github.com/sco3tt)!)
- Audible notification when switching the state! (Thanks [@AngryJKirk](https://github.com/AngryJKirk)!)

## Binaries
If you came here by accident, and don't want the source, but rather precompiled binaries, head over to [the Releases](https://github.com/DanielGilbert/dgMicMute/releases). You might want to pick the topmost release.

## FAQ
### I cannot find the microphone icon!
It's located in the lower right part of the Windows taskbar. Depending on your settings, you might need to press the "^"-arrow that's next to the symbols.
### Where do I set the hotkey?
Simply right-click on the icon, select "Settings..." and pick your Hotkey in the Settings.
### Where do I set the autostart?
Simply right-click on the icon, select "Settings..." and activate Autostart.
